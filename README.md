## What is this?
This is a plugin for Unifier which allows it to work on Revolt, a Discord alternative. This plugin manages the Revolt 
instance and allows messages from Revolt to be bridged to other platforms.

## Requirements
Unifier v2.0.5 or newer is required.

## Setup
To install Unifier Revolt Support, you can run `u!system install https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-revolt` on the bot.
This will install the plugin through System Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see an unknown service error if you use Unifier v2. This is because these versions do not support services
> providing Native Universal Platform Support (NUPS). Revolt Support should still work without NUPS on these versions.
